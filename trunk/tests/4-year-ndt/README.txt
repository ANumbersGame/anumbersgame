"First, when considering the debaters this amendment would affect, it's easy to think of those who choose to 'skip out of a certain NDT' to debate for all 5 years of eligibility.  I certainly respect and even envy those who are able to make this decision, but I believe debaters of this caliber aren't the majority."

"We all know certain students are now actively planning not to go to a certain NDT in order to debate during their fifth year."

I don't know if planning on skipping one NDT is a new phenomenon. Assuming it is, the number of first-year students who qualified for the NDT in previous seasons is a rough upper estimate on the number of people for whom skipping an NDT is an option, rather than a forced hand based on their skill as a freshperson college debater. Below are the numbers derived from Jon Brushke's database dumps from 2003-2008 on debateresults.com.

I counted a debater as debating in the open division if they debated in even one open division. Sometimes this includes non-qualifying divisions at district qualifying tournaments.

I counted a debater as new if they debated at least one round and nobody with the same name was registered on debateresults.com the previous year. I did not account for people who were registered the previous year, but didn't debate, or people who took one year off, or people who changed their name, or pairs of people with the same name.
