Nate Cohn has suggested that ballots between first round teams in which the affirmative is policy-focused will skew negative. This is a text of that. To do the test, I looked up the teams receiving first rounds in 2007-2008, then looked up their 07-08 affirmatives on the case list wiki:

I did read the whole pages, since they are very long, as well as mostly unformatted, but I did look them over for signs of critical affirmatives. I only saw these signs from Northwestern BM ans Emory MS.

Both including and excluding these two teams, I looked at the number of affirmative and negative wins between first roundsin 2007-2008.

In rounds between first round teams that year, the aff won 251 out of 528 ballots, or 47.54%.

Excluding rounds with Northwestern BM or Emory MS on the affirmative, the aff won 233 out of 487, or 47.84%.

The total aff win percentage in 2007-2008 was 48.64%.
