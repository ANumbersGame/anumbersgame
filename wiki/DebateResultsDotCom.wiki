[http://debateresults.com/ DebateResults.com] is a debate record website run by Jon Bruschke. It not only records tournament results, it also allows online tournament entry, assists NDT at-large bid preparation and voting, provides aggregate results for CEDA points, regional comparison, and team rankings, and provides several other services as well. It mostly caters to college tournaments; high school tournaments are run on a separate sub-site that hasn't been updated in a few years.

!DebateResults.com data goes back to 2002-2003, and (as of June, 2009) [http://commweb.fullerton.edu/jbruschke/web/ResultsArchives/archiveindex.aspx data from 2003-2008 is available in MS Access format].

= Alternate versions of !DebateResults.com data == 

A simple MySQL version of the !DebateResults.com data is [http://code.google.com/p/anumbersgame/downloads/list available via the "Downloads" tab]. Besides formatting, the main differences from the MS Access data are:

  * The simplified database includes the 2008-2009 season
  * The simplified database attempts to provide debaters, tournaments, and schools with unique IDs that span multiple years.

MySQL-friendly dumps of the raw MS Access data are also available in the repository, under [http://anumbersgame.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/data/debateresults/converted/mysql/ /trunk/data/debateresults/converted/mysql].
