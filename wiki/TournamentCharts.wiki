One way to measure debate team performance is with a metric called FairBets. A good presentation of the metric can be found in [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1588533582049225873 "Ranking participants in generalized tournaments"], by Giora Slutzki and Oscar Volij.

FairBets has many good properties, but one of its weakness is that it produces rankings that preserve _dominance_, which is described below. Dominance-preserving rankings may not be appropriate for debate tournaments.

To investigate this, I produced graphs displaying the dominance hierarchy in some debate tournaments. Some are pictured below. The rest may be found in [http://code.google.com/p/anumbersgame/source/browse/trunk/tests/team-rating/scc-visualize/ the subdirectories of tests/team-rating/scc-visualize], along with code for generating these graphs in SVG or PDF.

Graphs for every tournament in the DebateResultsDotCom archive (from the 2003-2004 season to the 2007-2008 season) are available.

= How to read the graphs =

In general, better teams are found at the top of the graph, colored green. Worse teams are at the bottom and in red. An arrow pointing from A to B means they debated and A won. The graphs ignore speaker points.

To be more specific, each node represents a "league" (see below). Leagues with only one member are labeled with the team name and their number of wins. Larger leagues get proportionally larger nodes, which  are labeled with the least and most wins by any member of that league.

Nodes are colored by their average win percentage: maroon is 0%, forest green is 100%.

There is an arrow from a node A to a node B when a member of A debated and beat a member of B. Consistent with the definition of league, there is no cycle of arrows between a set of nodes.

For the fine print, see "Graph infelicities" below.

= Leagues and dominance =

We say team A *indirectly beat* team B when either:

  * A beat B in a debate
  * There is a team C such that A beat C in a debate and C indirectly beat B

We say A and B are *indirectly tied* if A indirectly beat B and B indirectly beat A. A *league* is a maximal set of indirectly tied teams. That is, no two teams are both indirectly tied and not in the same league.

Under this definition, for every pair of leagues P,Q, either:

<dl>
<dt>P and Q are *incomparable*</dt>
<dd>No team in P debated any team in Q</dd>
<dt>P *dominates* Q</dt>
<dd>In every debate between members of P and Q, the team from *P* won</dd>
<dt>Q *dominates* P</dt>
<dd>In every debate between members of P and Q, the team from *Q* won</dd>
</dl>

We say a league P *weakly dominates* a league Q when

  * P dominates Q
  * There is a league R such that P dominates R and R weakly dominates Q

When P weakly dominates Q, FairBets ranks every team in P higher than every team in Q. When P and Q are incomparable, FairBets ranks every team in P incomparable to every team in Q.

For intra- (rather than _inter-_) league ratings, FairBets is much more sophisticated, producing not just _rankings_ (who is better than whom?) but _ratings_ (and how much better are they?). It does not classify any two league-mates as incomparable, and it gives an estimation of every team's odds against every other team, should they meet again. Furthermore, these odds are _fair_: had every team  in the league used these odds to bet on themselves in every league game, they all would have found themselves with the same amount of money they started with.

= Does normal tournament ranking respect dominance? =

No.

It's easy to find historical examples of tournaments where teams with lower win records dominate teams with higher win records.

<a href="http://anumbersgame.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tests/team-rating/scc-visualize/DebateResults0607/George%20R%20R%20Pflaum%20Debate%20Tournament%20%20Emporia.png"><img width="90%" src="http://anumbersgame.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tests/team-rating/scc-visualize/DebateResults0607/George%20R%20R%20Pflaum%20Debate%20Tournament%20%20Emporia.png"></img></a>

For example, at the Emporia debate tournament during the 2006-2007 season], KState !BiHo dominates Oklhma !DaZa, even though KState only has two wins and Oklhma has 4.

Some of the stranger tournament graphs can be explained by:

  * Teams getting early byes, then winning many later rounds
  * Errors in the data provided by DebateResultsDotCom
