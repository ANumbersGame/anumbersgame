#summary The number and status of hybrid teams

These charts are based on the data from DebateResultsDotCom. They aggregate the results over all five years available (2003-2008), but do not track debaters though the years. That is, stats are tracked via *debater-years* or *team-years*.

The charts are not accurately sized in relation to each other; this would make some of them too small to read.

== Terminology ==

On this page, a debater who has participated on a hybrid team is also called hybrid. Debaters who have _only_ participated on hybrid teams are called *ringers*, all others hybrid debaters are *drones*

Only 4% of teams are hybrid. Of those, 7.4% are made up of ringers, 58% are made up of drones, and the remainder of teams are mixed.

6.1% of debaters are hybrids. 23% of these are ringers.

= Tournaments and Ballots =

DebateResultsDotCom allows tournaments to specify whether or not they permit hybrid teams. Some tournaments, like Liberty, only allow hybrids in preliminary rounds, yet are still registered with "HybridsOK".

== Summary ==

  * 157 tournaments registered as not allowing hybrids, but 35% of these actually did have hybrids competing.
  * 61% of the 198 tournaments that did allow hybrids actually had some hybrids debating.
  * Tournaments where hybrids debated generated proportionally (and absolutely) more ballots than those where no hybrids debated.
