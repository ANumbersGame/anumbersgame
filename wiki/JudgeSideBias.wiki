#summary Historical data on judge side bias

This page lists historical judge side bias derived from the [DebateResultsDotCom DebateResults.com data].

The column labeled "*prob*" is an upper limit on the probability that the decisions by that judge were consistent with those of the judge population as a whole. This is calculated from the binomial distribution and the Clopper-Pearson confidence interval. For more information on binomial confidence intervals, see [http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-842X.2007.00501.x Problems with Binomial Two-sided Tests and the Associated Confidence Intervals].

Since there are so many judges, the presence of a few judges with skewed ballot counts is not necessarily an indication of their inherent bias; these judges may simply have seen an unusual number of lopsided rounds.

[http://code.google.com/p/anumbersgame/source/browse/#svn/trunk/tests/judge-side-bias The code to calculate this data can be found in the source tree under "tests/judge-side-bias"].

As always, these accuracy of these statistical results is reduced by any inaccuracies in the raw data.

= Response to Russell Hanes's analysis =

This section is a response to a post at [http://art-of-logic.blogspot.com/2009/08/judge-side-bias-whole-field.html Russell Hanes's blog]. I'm putting it here because it's nice to have comments under version control.

Russell, I enjoyed reading your post. Will you post the code to show how you generated the graph and the numbers?

[http://code.google.com/p/anumbersgame/source/browse/trunk/tests/judge-side-bias/hanes.sql I tried to duplicate your results], but the numbers I got were very different from yours:

|| *season* || *outside the green line* || *on the green line* ||
|| '03-'04  || 33.84% || 0.00% ||
|| '04-'05  || 34.96% || 0.00% ||
|| '05-'06  || 35.61% || 0.00% ||
|| '06-'07  || 30.45% || 0.00% ||
|| '07-'08  || 35.94% || 0.00% ||
|| '08-'09  || 30.52% || 0.00% ||

Another way to see how the actual judge side biases compare against the expected judge side biases is to measure each judge by his or her [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-score z-score]. When testing enough judges with enough rounds each, the distribution of z-scores should be [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution normal] with a mean of 0 and a variance of 1.

Charts for each year are reproduced below, using only judges with 12 or more rounds. The actual distributions don't look tighter than the expected distributions; all the variances are near 1.

Another way to more accurately discover any deviations from the expected distribution without depending on how close the binomial distribution is to the normal distribution would be to calculate the binomial distribution for each judge's n, then sum these distributions. This would give a better approximation of the expected total distribution. One could include even judges with small numbers of rounds. You could then compare the actual aff-win-percentage-per-judge distribution against the ideal one using a non-parametric test like like the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov-Smirnov_test Kolmogorov-Smirnov test].

In any case, the judges listed above don't deviate from the judge side bias we would expect to find at the tails of judge side bias distributions, given how many judges and how many rounds there are every year.
