One way to measure if a topic was biased towards the aff or the neg is to simply check the number of ballots that went aff. There is a confounding variable of team ability, though, since power matching at tournaments is a very rough way to match teams of equal ability. The large number of rounds between teams of very unequal ability may swamp any topic bias visibility.

If we measure and account for team quality, we can predict more accurately topic side bias. This had been done before with home-field advantage and presentation order using the Bradley-Terry model of paired comparisons.

In the basic Bradley-Terry model, it is assumed that teams i and j have intrinsic abilities pi and pj. The total ability in a debate between the two is pi+pj, and the probability that i wins is equal to i's total share of the ability displayed: {{{pi/(pi+pj)}}}. This model is a [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22bradley-terry%22 very popular] way of measuring preferences in scientific experiments. It has been reinvented at least three times since the original invention in 1929 by Zermelo: Bradley and Terry in 1952, Ford in 1957, and Jech in 1983. It is sometimes called the Bradley-Terry-Luce Model, the Zermelo model, or maximum likelihood (which is actually a way of estimating the parameters of the model, rather than the model itself).

In the model of Bradley-Terry that accounts for side bias, there is assumed to be a parameter t such that the probability of i beating j is {{{(t * pi)/(t*pi + pj)}}} when i is aff. In other words, t is a measure of the amplification of a team's ability by being affirmative. 

After calculating the parameter t, one can decide whether there is a side bias based on t's distance from 1 and by how much more accurate the model is when accounting for side bias. For more details, see [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6050716066748286974 Davidson and Beaver's "On extending the Bradley-Terry model to incorporate within-pair order effects"] and [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1036704245272414243 Hunter's "MM algorithms for generalized Bradley-Terry models"] as well as the [http://code.google.com/p/anumbersgame/source/browse/trunk/tests/fair-bets code used to generate the data below].

The chart below shows t's distance from 1, in percent, or (1/t)'s distance from 1 when t < 1. The latter is more often the case; t more often shows a negative topic bias than an affirmative one. The significance is based on how much more likely the observed result is when assuming a side-biased model.

The energy, China, and security guarantee topics show highly statistically significant negative topic bias. The other three topics show no statistically significant bias either way.

=Comparison to NDT first-round at-large bids=

As a sanity check, we can compare the Bradley-Terry ratings (with and without side bias correction) to the [http://groups.wfu.edu/NDT/HistoricalLists/copeland.html top five first-round teams]. The first-rounds were ranked in mid-February, while the Bradley-Terry ratings are based on the entire season.
