One way to measure if a topic was biased towards the aff or the neg is to simply check the number of ballots that went aff. There is a confounding variable of team ability, though, since power matching at tournaments is a very rough way to match teams of equal ability. The large number of rounds between teams of very unequal ability may swamp any topic bias visibility.

=Methodology=

If we account for team quality, we can more accurately measure topic side bias. This has been done before with home-field advantage and presentation order using the *Bradley-Terry* model for paired comparisons.

In the basic Bradley-Terry model, it is assumed that teams {{{i}}} and {{{j}}} have intrinsic abilities {{{pi}}} and {{{pj}}}. The total ability in a debate between the two is {{{pi+pj}}}, and the probability that {{{i}}} wins is equal to {{{i}}}'s total share of the ability displayed: {{{pi/(pi+pj)}}}. This model is a [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22bradley-terry%22 very popular] way of measuring preferences in scientific experiments. It has been reinvented at least three times since the [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=10348565627147554444 original invention in 1929 by Zermelo]: [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3342470457888860512 Bradley and Terry in 1952], [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=17948963708584189499 Ford in 1957], and [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11957541490945283103 Jech in 1983]. It is sometimes called the Bradley-Terry-Luce model, the Zermelo model, or maximum likelihood (which is actually a way of estimating the parameters of the model, rather than the model itself, see [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1976262193035074609 Brozos-Vazquez et al.] and [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=5491505416511234457 Stob]).

In the model of Bradley-Terry that accounts for side bias, there is assumed to be a parameter {{{t}}} such that the probability of {{{i}}} beating {{{j}}} is {{{(t*pi)/(t*pi + pj)}}} when {{{i}}} is aff. In other words, {{{t}}} is a measure of the amplification of a team's ability by being affirmative. 

After calculating the parameter {{{t}}}, one can decide whether there is a side bias based on {{{t}}}'s distance from 1 and by how much more accurate the model is when accounting for side bias. For more details, see [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6050716066748286974 Davidson and Beaver's "On extending the Bradley-Terry model to incorporate within-pair order effects"] and [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1036704245272414243 Hunter's "MM algorithms for generalized Bradley-Terry models"] as well as the [http://code.google.com/p/anumbersgame/source/browse/trunk/tests/fair-bets code used to generate the data below].

=Results=

The chart below shows {{{t}}}'s distance from 1, in percent, or {{{(1/t)}}}'s distance from 1 when {{{t < 1}}}. The latter is more often the case; {{{t}}} more often shows a negative topic bias than an affirmative one. The significance values displayed are based on how much more likely the observed result is when assuming a side-biased model than when assuming a side-neutral model.

The energy, China, and security guarantee topics show highly statistically significant negative topic bias. The other three topics show no statistically significant bias either way.

None of this data analysis would be possible without the excellent work done by Jon Bruschke at DebateResultsDotCom.

The percent bias numbers _do not_ indicate a team's increased probability of winning; a 10% neg bias does not mean the neg will win 55% of otherwise evenly matched rounds, or 88% of otherwise 80%-neg rounds. It means the neg's strength is amplified by 10%.

As an example, if the neg bias amplifier is 10%:

|| *Aff team strength* || *Neg team strength* || *Neg wins with unbiased topic* || *Neg wins with 10% neg biased topic* ||
|| 99 || 1 || 1% || 1.10% ||
|| 1 || 99 || 99% || 99.09% ||
|| 50 || 50 || 50% || 52.38% ||

*The largest bias in the past six years was the 12.37% neg bias on the energy topic. With this neg bias, in an otherwise evenly matched round, the neg has only a 52.91% chance of winning.*

=Comparison to NDT first-round at-large bids=

As a sanity check that the Bradley-Terry ratings correspond with conventional wisdom on team strength, we can compare the BT ratings (with and without side bias correction) to the [http://groups.wfu.edu/NDT/HistoricalLists/copeland.html top five first-round teams]. (N.B.: The first-rounds were ranked in mid-February, while the Bradley-Terry ratings are based on the entire season.)
