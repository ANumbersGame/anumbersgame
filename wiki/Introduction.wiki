#summary Getting started

The goal of this project is to produce some interesting statistics from aggregated debate results.

Right now, the only raw data used is from DebateResultsDotCom.

As of May 11, 2009, the data analyses available here are:

  * [TournamentCharts Transitive prelim rounds win graphs for tournaments]
  * HybridTeams
  * [Attendance CEDA vs. NDT applicants/attendees]
  * [http://anumbersgame.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tests/first-round-team-type/README.txt Resolutional side bias of first round types by affirmative style]
  * [http://anumbersgame.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tests/4-year-ndt/README.txt How many freshpersons might consider skipping an NDT under the only-four-NDTs rule?]

[http://code.google.com/p/anumbersgame/w/list There is also a list of all wiki pages].
