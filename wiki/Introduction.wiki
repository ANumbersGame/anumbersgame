#summary Getting started

The goal of this project is to produce some interesting statistics from aggregated debate results.

Right now, the only raw data used is from DebateResultsDotCom.

As of July 21, 2009, the available pages are:

  * [RatingSystems A list of rating and ranking systems, focused on those used for college policy debate]
  * [SpeakerPointScale The effects of changing speaker point range and granularity]
  * [TournamentCharts Transitive prelim rounds win graphs for tournaments]
  * HybridTeams
  * [Attendance CEDA vs. NDT applicants/attendees]
  * [http://anumbersgame.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tests/first-round-team-type/README.txt Resolutional side bias of first round types by affirmative style]
  * [http://anumbersgame.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tests/4-year-ndt/README.txt How many freshpersons might consider skipping an NDT under the only-four-NDTs rule?]
