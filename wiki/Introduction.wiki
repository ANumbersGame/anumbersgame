#summary Getting started

The goal of this project is to produce some interesting statistics from aggregated debate results.

Right now, the only raw data used is from DebateResultsDotCom.

As of May 7, 2009, the novel measurements here are:

  * JudgeSideBias
  * TournamentCharts
  * HybridTeams

Please feel free to recommend statistics you would like to see by using [http://code.google.com/p/anumbersgame/issues/list the issue tracker].
