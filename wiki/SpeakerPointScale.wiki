In recent years, two large tournaments have changed from the usual speaker point scale  of (roughly) 24 to (exactly) 30 by half-point increments: Wake Forest has moved to a 100-point scale, with increments of 1, and USC has moved to a quarter-point, then to a tenth-point increment while preserving the 30-point maximum. The Georgia State tournament in the 2009-2010 season [http://www.gsudebate.org/events_at_gsu/gsu_national_college_debate.html will be using a 100 point scale].

Below are some charts showing the difference these changes have made. The data is drawn from the open division rounds available in the DebateResultsDotCom database.

= Overview =

Increasing the range or decreasing the increment of the speaker point scale increased the differentiation between different debaters in the same round and between different rounds for each debater.

On the other hand, judges did not use the full range of points, especially when the new scale maintained the traditional 30-point maximum. Keeping the same point range while decreasing the increment allowed many judges to either ignore or forget that any change was made at all. Giving particular examples from the allowable range inspired some judges to stick to those examples.

= Distinction Between Performances =

In the '06-'07 season, both tournaments used the 30-point scale with half-point increments. In '07-'08, Wake moved to a 100-point scale and USC moved to quarter-point increments. For '08-'09, USC moved from its quarter-point system to an even finer-grained tenth-point system.

Increasing the range or decreasing the increment of the speaker point scale increased the number of distinct speaker points assigned per round, directly addressing the reason for the USC's change, to [http://www.usctrojandebate.com/college_tournaments.html "help differentiate the quality of individual speakers"].

The charts below display the percentage of rounds with the given number of distinct speaker points.

Larger range or finer granularity has also helped differentiate between the quality of a debater's performances in different rounds of the tournament. The charts below show the likelihood of a debater being assigned the given number of distinct speaker points over the course of the tournament.

The new Wake scale seems to have expanded the lower range of the point distribution, while the width and peak of the point distribution under the new USC scales seem to have remained roughly the same.

= Local Peaks =

The speaker points assigned under these new systems did not follow the familiar bell-shaped distribution. At Wake Forest, points clustered around multiples of five; at USC the peaks were around the values available on the old half-point scale. These distribution patterns repeated themselves at both tournaments in the '08-'09 season. 

== Adjustment Period ==

One possible explanation for these peaks is that judges show increasing comfort assigning off-peak speaker points as the tournament goes on. The charts below show the percentage of off-peak points assigned during each round. For comparison, the '06-'07 season is included, treating the integer point values as local peaks, though the charts above show that they are actually not peaks.

Neither USC nor Wake Forest show any trend away from the local peaks as the tournament progressed

== Uncooperative Judges ==

Another possible explanation of the local peaks is that some set of judges simply do not assign off-peak points. The charts below display how many rounds at each tournament were judged by judges who did not assign in any round any point values other than those at the local peaks in the point distributions displayed above. Again, '06-'07 is included for comparison.

At USC, a significant percentage of judges either forgot about the new system or declined to use it. In contrast, the local peaks in the Wake Forest point distribution are not coming from some isolated population of judges that only assign on-peak points.
Focusing on the judges in the USC pool who are willing to use the new granularity, it becomes clear that almost all the local clustering in the '07-'08 tournament is due to judges who stick to the old half-point scale. In contrast, at the '08-'09 USC tournament, even judges who do use the new tenth-point scale tend to cluster around the old half-point scale.

In addition to the half-point values, the '08-'09 USC invite specifically mentioned speaker point values ending in ".3" and ".8":

<blockquote>

There is visible clustering around ".3" and ".8" values, even though the text of the invite said all tenths values would be accepted. A substantial number of open rounds were judged by someone who never strayed from the example scale given in the invite:

== The Effect of Uncooperative Judges ==

Regarding judges who decline to use a scale with finer granularity, Gary Larson (quoted in [http://commweb.fullerton.edu/jbruschke/Web/how%20to%20tab%20text.doc Jon Bruschke's "A Primer on Debate Tabulation"]) [http://www.ndtceda.com/pipermail/edebate/2005-October/063965.html notes]:

<blockquote>
There is both a philosophical and practical consideration here. The philosophical issues have received some discussion in measurement theory, which suggests that when measures are aggregated the resulting sum or average can’t be conceived of as more precise than the least precise measure that is aggregated. If we’re measuring how far someone throws a football and some observers pace it off, some use a yardstick, some use a tape measure with inches indicated (no fractions) and others use a tape measure calibrated to millimeters, any attempt to aggregate or compare their observations can’t use or report any more precision than that obtained by the person pacing off the throws. A common trick question in ninth grade general science is to ask students to add 27 + 26.4 + 28.32 with the correct answer being 81 as opposed to 81.72 (or even 82). The whole trick is significant digits. To get 81.72 we would need to add 27.00 + 26.40 + 28.32. We need to note that the observer who reported 27 might have actually observed 26.51 but rounded to 27. In a debate context, if SOME observers use decimals and others don’t we can’t make any valid or reliable comparisons or aggregations of their scores. If one judge rounds to halfs and another reports decimals, we might incorrectly conclude that the 27.5 reported by the former is higher than the 27.4 reported by the latter (even though they had actually rounded it from what they might have thought was a 27.3 if they could have or would have used decimals). For some communities, even using halfs creates comparison and aggregation problems since some judges always report points as whole numbers. Unless EVERYONE simultaneously moves to decimal precision, the entire process has become less reliable rather than more if we pretend that we can use the decimals to distinguish awards.

The practical consideration is less critical but is still substantial. The use of
decimals significantly increases ballot entry time. Both [http://www.dannycantrell.net/sta/ STA-XL] and [http://www3.baylor.edu/~Richard_Edwards/TRPC.html TRPC] are designed to minimize keystrokes by assuming .5 increments. Other increments can be entered but require more keystrokes.

I disagree with this. If "27" means "a number drawn from the uniform probability distribution on (26.5,27.5)", then the expected value of the sum is actually 81.72. This is why, I think, high school chemistry students [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q="in+a+series+of+calculations+carry+the+extra+digits" are often told to round only after doing all the arithmetic].

== Point Clustering For Winning Teams ==

In [http://www.cross-x.com/vb/showthread.php?p=1740435#post1740435 a discussion of this on cross-x.com], "Organization XIII" asked:

<blockquote>
What about the winners bracket? `[ . . . ]` I say winners bracket theoretically those are the better teams debating with the more preferred better judging.  I don't think anyone really cares if the 0-5 bracket really has a constant 5 point interval system.
</blockquote>

The short answer is that whatever difference there may be, it is not enough to make rounds where points may affect seeding at or above the break follow a normal distribution.

Of the four times non-traditional points were used, two show a difference between the percentages of off-peak points given in rounds in which both teams are going to miss the break (*no-break rounds*) and and rounds in which at least one team has a chance of breaking (*may-break rounds*). I haven't run any statistical tests to see if the difference is significant.

The vast majority of rounds have at least one team that might break, since it takes many rounds to end up down enough that a team is definitely not breaking. For instance, at USC in '08-'09, only 23 of 322 preliminary open rounds were between two teams who would definitely not break. Since some 4-3 teams made the cut, a team had to have 4 losses to know they wouldn't break. If a difference shows up, then, it is because of more point clustering in a small group of less-consequential rounds rather than less point clustering in a small group of more-consequential rounds. There is not some cadre of highly-preferred judges who judge most of the may-break rounds.

At USC '08-'09, 60% of points in no-break rounds ended in .0 or .5. Only 46% of points in may-break rounds ended in .0 or .5. This seems like a big difference, but the number one would expect by chance alone would be about 20%, so 46% brings the numbers closer to a normal distribution without actually bringing them close.

A chart of the actual points assigned at USC '08-'09 in may-break rounds shows that there is still clustering around half-point values:

At USC the year before, there was no real difference between the percentage of on-peak points assigned in no-break rounds and the percentage of on-peak points assigned in may-break rounds. (68% vs. 64%)

At Wake '07-'08, 68 of 536 rounds were between two teams that had already been precluded from breaking by having lost 5 or more rounds. 37% of points in no-break rounds were divisible by 5; in may-break rounds, this number was only 30%. There is still visible clustering around multiples of 5:

Speaker point distributions for teams who end up with a winning prelim record do look marginally smoother, but only when they have a narrower range:
