#summary The effect of changing the the speaker point scale

In recent years, two large tournaments have changed from the usual speaker point scale  of (roughly) 24 to (exactly) 30 by half-point increments: Wake Forest has moved to a 100-point scale, with increments of 1, and USC has moved to a quarter-point, then to a tenth-point increment while preserving the 30-point maximum. The Georgia State tournament in the 2009-2010 season [http://www.gsudebate.org/events_at_gsu/gsu_national_college_debate.html will be using a 100 point scale].

Below are some charts showing the difference these changes have made. The data is drawn from the open division rounds available in the DebateResultsDotCom database.

= Overview =

Increasing the range or granularity of the speaker point scale increased the differentiation between different debaters in the same round and between different rounds for each debater. On the other hand, judges did not use the full range of points, especially when the new scale maintained the traditional 30-point maximum. Keeping the same point range while increasing the granularity allowed many judges to either ignore or forget that any change was made at all.

= Distinction Between Performances =

In the '06-'07 season, both tournaments used the 30-point scale with half-point increments. In '07-'08, Wake moved to a 100-point scale and USC moved to quarter-point increments. For '08-'09, USC had moved from its quarter-point system to an even finer-grained tenth-point system.

Increasing the range or granularity of the speaker point scale increased the number of distinct speaker points assigned per round, directly addressing the reason for the USC's change, to [http://www.usctrojandebate.com/college_tournaments.html "help differentiate the quality of individual speakers"].

The charts below display the percent of rounds with the given number of distinct speaker points.

Larger range or granularity has also helped differentiate between the quality of a debater's performances in different rounds of the tournament. The charts below show the likelihood of a debater being assigned the given number of distinct speaker points over the course of the tournament.

The new Wake scale seems to have expanded the lower range of the point distribution, while the width and peak of the point distribution under the new USC scales seem to have remained roughly the same.

= Local Peaks =

The speaker points assigned under these new systems did not follow the familiar bell-shaped distribution. At Wake Forest, points clustered around multiples of five; at USC the peaks were around the values available on the old half-point scale. These distribution patterns repeated themselves at both tournaments in the '08-'09 season. 

== Adjustment Period ==

One possible explanation for these peaks is that judges show increasing comfort assigning off-peak speaker points as the tournament goes on. The charts below show the percentage of off-peak points assigned during each round. For comparison, the '06-'07 season is included, treating the integer point values as local peaks, though the charts above show that they are actually not peaks.

Neither USC nor Wake Forest show any trend away from the local peaks as the tournament progressed

== Uncooperative Judges ==

Another possible explanation of the local peaks is that some set of judges simply do not assign off-peak points. The charts below display how many rounds at each tournament were judged by judges who did not assign in any round any point values other than those at the local peaks in the point distributions displayed above. Again, '06-'07 is included for comparison.

At USC, a significant percentage of judges either forgot about the new system or declined to use it. In contrast, the local peaks in the Wake Forest point distribution are not coming from some isolated population of judges that only assign on-peak points.

Focusing on the judges in the USC pool who are willing to use the new granularity, it becomes clear that almost all the local clustering in the '07-'08 tournament is due to judges who stick to the old half-point scale. In contrast, at '08-'09 USC tournament, even judges who do use the new tenth-point scale tend to cluster around the old half-point scale.
